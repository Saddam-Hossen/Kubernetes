# Kubernetes Deployment with Multiple Containers in One Pod

## Overview

In Kubernetes, a **Pod** is the smallest deployable unit and can run one or more containers that share the same network namespace, storage volumes, and lifecycle. Running multiple containers in a single Pod is useful when those containers are tightly coupled and need to work closely together.

---

## Why Use Multiple Containers in a Single Pod?

* **Sidecar pattern:** Helper containers that extend or support the main application container (e.g., log shipping, monitoring).
* **Shared volumes:** Containers share data through mounted volumes.
* **Local communication:** Containers communicate using `localhost` without network overhead.
* **Tightly coupled services:** Services that must be scheduled on the same node and coordinate closely.

---

## Example Deployment Manifest

The example below defines a Deployment that runs a Pod with **3 containers**:

* `devicemanagement-container`: Your main application container running the Device Management app on port 8080.
* `logger-container`: A simple logging sidecar that prints logs every 10 seconds.
* `heartbeat-container`: A heartbeat sidecar that prints a heartbeat message every 5 seconds.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: devicemanagement-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: devicemanagement
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: devicemanagement
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: devicemanagement-container
          image: devicemanagement-app
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080

        - name: logger-container
          image: busybox
          command: ["sh", "-c", "while true; do echo 'Logging...'; sleep 10; done"]

        - name: heartbeat-container
          image: busybox
          command: ["sh", "-c", "while true; do echo 'Heartbeat...'; sleep 5; done"]
```

## Explanation

| Field                        | Description                                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `spec.containers`            | Defines the containers running inside the Pod.                                     |
| `devicemanagement-container` | Main app container, exposing port 8080.                                            |
| `logger-container`           | Sidecar container printing log messages every 10 seconds.                          |
| `heartbeat-container`        | Sidecar container printing heartbeat messages every 5 seconds.                     |
| `imagePullPolicy`            | Defines image pull behavior (e.g., `IfNotPresent` to avoid unnecessary pulls).     |
| `command`                    | Overrides the default container command to run a shell loop for continuous output. |

## Important Notes

* All containers run inside the **same Pod**, so they share:

  * **Network:** Reach each other via `localhost`.
  * **Storage:** You can add shared volumes if needed.
* Containers in the same Pod share lifecycle â€” if the Pod is terminated, all containers stop together.
* Use sidecars to extend main app functionality without modifying the main container.

---

## When to Use This Pattern

* When you need helper containers tightly coupled with the main app.
* When containers must share data or network directly.
* When you want to run logging, monitoring, or maintenance tasks as separate containers.

---

If you want, I can also help you extend this manifest with:

* Shared volumes (e.g., `emptyDir`)
* Environment variables to coordinate containers
* Health checks for sidecars
* Resource limits for each container
