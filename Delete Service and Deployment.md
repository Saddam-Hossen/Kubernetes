Great question!

When you delete a **Kubernetes service**, you're **only deleting the service object**, **not the underlying application (Pods, Deployments, or ReplicaSets)**.

---

### 🎯 What Happens When You Delete a Service?

For example:

```bash
kubectl delete service devicemanagement-service
```

#### ✅ Deletes:

* The **Service object** (i.e., the internal or external way to access your app)

#### ❌ Does *not* delete:

* The **Deployment**
* The **Pods**
* The **ReplicaSets**
* The **Container** running inside Pods

---

### 💡 Example

Imagine you deployed an app like this:

```bash
kubectl create deployment myapp --image=nginx
kubectl expose deployment myapp --type=NodePort --port=80
```

Now if you run:

```bash
kubectl delete service myapp
```

* The **`myapp` service** is gone — you can't access your app externally anymore.
* But the **Pods** still exist.
* Run `kubectl get pods` and you'll still see your app running.

---

### ✅ How to See Everything Related to Your App

Run:

```bash
kubectl get all
```

This will show:

* Pods
* Services
* Deployments
* ReplicaSets

---

### 💥 To Completely Delete an App (Service + Pods + Deployment)

Use:

```bash
kubectl delete deployment myapp
```

This deletes:

* The **Deployment**
* All **ReplicaSets** and **Pods** it manages
* But the **Service** (if any) still exists unless you delete it separately

Or if you want to clean up **everything** created by a YAML file:

```bash
kubectl delete -f your-app.yaml
```
