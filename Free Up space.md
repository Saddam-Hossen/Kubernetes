When you delete a **Kubernetes deployment**, Kubernetes does **not leave behind history, RAM usage, or other persistent system-level traces** under normal operation. But to fully clean up and free all possible associated resources (like logs, memory, volumes, etc.), here's what you should know and do:

---

### âœ… 1. **Delete the Deployment**

```bash
kubectl delete deployment your-deployment-name
```

This removes:

* The Deployment
* All ReplicaSets managed by it
* All Pods created by it

---

### âœ… 2. **Delete the Service (if any)**

```bash
kubectl delete service your-service-name
```

This removes access to the app (like NodePort, LoadBalancer).

---

### âœ… 3. **Check for Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)**

If your app uses **persistent storage** (like saving files or DB data), Kubernetes may have created PVCs.

Check for PVCs:

```bash
kubectl get pvc
```

Delete them if you want to remove data:

```bash
kubectl delete pvc your-pvc-name
```

---

### âœ… 4. **Check for ConfigMaps and Secrets**

Sometimes Deployments use external configs.

Check:

```bash
kubectl get configmaps
kubectl get secrets
```

Delete them:

```bash
kubectl delete configmap your-config
kubectl delete secret your-secret
```

---

### âœ… 5. **Check for Horizontal Pod Autoscalers, Jobs, or CronJobs**

They donâ€™t get deleted with a Deployment.

```bash
kubectl get hpa
kubectl get jobs
kubectl get cronjobs
```

Delete them if needed:

```bash
kubectl delete hpa your-hpa
kubectl delete job your-job
kubectl delete cronjob your-cronjob
```

---

### âœ… 6. **Free RAM and CPU Usage**

Once Pods are deleted (automatically by deleting the deployment), the **RAM and CPU are freed** by Kubernetes.

To confirm:

```bash
kubectl top nodes
```

This shows your current resource usage.

---

### âœ… 7. **Delete Logs (optional)**

Kubernetes logs are stored per pod. When you delete a pod, its logs are typically deleted too.

To be sure:

* For container runtimes like **containerd**, **Docker**, or **CRI-O**, logs might persist on the node.
* You can manually delete log files on the node (requires root):

  ```bash
  sudo rm -rf /var/log/pods
  sudo rm -rf /var/log/containers
  ```

---

### âœ… 8. **(Optional) Delete the Namespace**

If you deployed everything in a dedicated namespace, just delete the namespace to remove all resources at once:

```bash
kubectl delete namespace your-namespace
```
