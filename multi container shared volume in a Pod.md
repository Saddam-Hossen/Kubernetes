#####Shared Volume####
Yes, absolutely! In Kubernetes, you can share a **volume** between containers in the **same pod**, allowing one container (e.g., your main Spring Boot app) to **write logs** to a file, while the **sidecar container** (your logging app) can **read and process** those logs in real-time.

---

### ‚úÖ Why Use a Shared Volume?

This pattern is ideal for:

* File-based log processing
* Custom parsing, aggregation, or forwarding
* Decoupling business logic from logging mechanics

---

### üì¶ Volume Sharing in Pod YAML

Here‚Äôs how you can define it in your `multi-container-pod.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: springboot-multi-container
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: shared-logs
      emptyDir: {}  # Temporary storage shared between containers

  containers:
    - name: main-app
      image: main-app:latest
      volumeMounts:
        - name: shared-logs
          mountPath: /app/logs

    - name: logger-app
      image: logger-app:latest
      volumeMounts:
        - name: shared-logs
          mountPath: /logs
```

---

### üìù Log Writing (Main App)

Your Spring Boot main app should write logs to `/app/logs/app.log`:

```yaml
# application.properties
logging.file.name=/app/logs/app.log
```

---

### üìñ Log Reading (Logger App)

The logger container can read `/logs/app.log`, for example:

```java
File logFile = new File("/logs/app.log");
try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(logFile))) {
    String line;
    while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
        System.out.println("Parsed Log: " + line);
    }
}
```

Or for real-time monitoring, use a tailing mechanism like `tail -F` or `watchService`.

### üõ†Ô∏è Summary

| Component  | Role                     | Path        | Volume        |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | ----------- | ------------- |
| Main App   | Writes logs to file      | `/app/logs` | `shared-logs` |
| Logger App | Reads and processes logs | `/logs`     | `shared-logs` |
